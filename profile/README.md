## About

The repositories here contain code or “code-like” content, which was created by the members of the [DH Lab at the Leibniz Institute of European History](https://www.ieg-mainz.de/en/research/digital_historical_research/dh-lab) (Mainz, Germany).
The primary purpose is to provide an institutional home for repositories that do not fit into personal accounts. It neither provides an exhaustive view of our coding nor serves as a showroom for it.

If you want to learn more about our research, you should have a look at the posts in our [blog](www.dhlab.net).
