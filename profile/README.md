## Hi there 👋

The repositories here contain code or “code-like” content, which was created by the members of the DH Lab at the Leibniz Institute of European History (Mainz, Germany).
The primary purpose of the IEG GitHub organization is to provide an institutional home for repositories that do not fit into personal accounts. It neither provides an exhaustive view of our coding nor serves as a showroom for it.

If you want to learn more about our research, you should have a look at the posts in our blog: www.dhlab.net
